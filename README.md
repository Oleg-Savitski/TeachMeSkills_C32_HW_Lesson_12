Task 1.

Write a program that contains hexadecimal code to describe.
Example, before entering the value #8b2323 into the program,
the program will take a long time to return Yes.

Task 2.

Write a program that will verify that the entered link is valid.
For example, when analyzing such a link https://teachmeskills.by/kursy/programmirovaniya-online -
the program should return that the link is valid.
and when you enter tcp://teachmeskills.by/kursy/programmirovaniya-online - 
the program should return that the link is not valid (the link starts with neither http nor https).

Task 3.

Enter a number of any length (from zero to infinity). We need to find the sum of his numbers.

Task 4.

Finding the largest common divisor (GCD).


Task 5. 
"The task is completed with the addition of additional functionality."

A bank deposit.
The user makes a contribution in the amount of a rubles for a period of years at 10% per annum
(every year the amount of his contribution increases by 10%.This money is added to
the deposit amount, and there will also be interest on it next year).
Write a bank program that accepts the arguments a and years, and returns
the amount that will be in the user's account.

Task 6.

Rotate the array of n elements to the right by k steps.
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] rotates to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Task 7.

Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a given number.
The twoSum function should return the indexes of two numbers so that they add
up to the target number. For example:
Input: numbers = {2, 7, 11, 15}, the goal = 9.
Output: index [1] = 0, index [2] = 1.

Task 8.

Having two words (beginning and end) and a dictionary, find the length of the shortest
sequence of transformations from beginning to end, in which
only one letter can be changed at a time.
And every intermediate word must exist in the dictionary.
For example, given:
start = "hit"
end = "cog"
dict = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log"]
One shortest conversion is "hit" â€”> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
the program should return a length of 5.
